            <li>
              Ethical Concerns: <br>
              As AI systems become more sophisticated, ethical considerations arise regarding their use. One major concern
              is the potential for bias in AI algorithms, which can perpetuate existing social biases and discrimination.
              Additionally, issues related to data privacy and security can arise when AI systems handle sensitive
              personal information. Ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI development and deployment
              is crucial to mitigate these ethical risks.

            <li>
              Job Displacement: <br>
              The automation capabilities of AI can lead to job displacement and workforce disruption. AI-powered
              machines and systems can replace human workers in various industries, particularly in repetitive and routine tasks. While AI also creates new job opportunities, reskilling and upskilling the workforce to
              adapt to the changing job market becomes essential to mitigate the negative impacts of job displacement.

            <li>
              Dependence on AI: <br>
              Over reliance on AI systems can pose risks if they are not designed or maintained properly. AI systems
              may encounter errors or glitches that can have significant consequences, especially in critical domains
              such as healthcare or autonomous vehicles. There is a need for continuous monitoring, maintenance, and
              robust fail-safe mechanisms to prevent and mitigate potential risks associated with AI system failures.

            <img src="pictures/security.png">
            <li>
              Security Threats: <br>
              The increased adoption of AI introduces new security vulnerabilities. AI systems can be targeted by
              malicious actors who seek to exploit vulnerabilities for their own gain. Adversarial attacks, where AI
              systems are manipulated to produce incorrect results, can have severe consequences, such as compromising
              the integrity of financial transactions or causing errors in autonomous systems. Robust security measures,
              including thorough testing and safeguards against attacks, are crucial to protect AI systems and the data
              they process.

          <p class="overall">
            These risks associated with AI highlight the importance of responsible development, implementation, and
            governance of AI technologies. It is crucial to address ethical concerns, consider the societal impact,
            and ensure adequate safeguards to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks.
