                <h1>Concept and types of Artificial Intelligence</h1>

                <div id="text1">
                    <p class="one">
                        In this digital age, AI has emerged as a groundbreaking technology that holds immense potential to
                        transform various aspects of our lives. At its core, AI refers to the development of intelligent
                        machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These machines
                        are designed to perceive their environment, reason, learn, and make decisions, mimicking human cognitive abilities.

                    <p class="one">
                        AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI,
                        is designed to perform specific tasks with exceptional proficiency. It is the AI we commonly encounter in
                        our day-to-day lives, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation algorithms used in online platforms.

                    <p class="one">
                        On the other hand, General AI, also known as Strong AI, aims to create machines with the ability to
                        understand, learn, and perform any intellectual task that a human being can do. General AI strives to
                        replicate human-like intelligence, reasoning, and adaptability. Although we are yet to achieve true General AI,
                        ongoing research and advancements in the field are continuously pushing the boundaries.

                        Within the realm of AI, various subfields and techniques are employed to tackle different challenges.
                        Machine Learning (ML) focuses on enabling computers to learn and improve from data without being explicitly
                        programmed. Deep Learning, a subset of ML, utilizes artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to
                        process and analyze complex data, leading to impressive advancements in image and speech recognition.

                    <p class="one">
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand and interpret human language, enabling
                        applications like chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis. Computer Vision involves the development
                        of algorithms that enable computers to interpret and analyze visual data, leading to advancements in fields
                        such as object detection and self-driving cars.
